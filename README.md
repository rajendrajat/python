### 👋 Rajendra Jat — Python Learning Roadmap

#### 🌱 Currently Learning: Python (Starting from the Ground Up)

I’ve just embarked on an exciting journey to master Python. This space will evolve as I build projects, deepen my knowledge, and solidify best practices. My approach is traditional — mastering the basics thoroughly — while keeping an eye on forward-thinking trends like AI, cloud, and automation.

### 🗺️ Roadmap

#### ✅ **Phase 1: Build Strong Foundations**

* Learn syntax, data types, and basic data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dicts)
* Understand control flow (if-else, loops) and error handling
* Practice coding exercises every day (LeetCode, HackerRank)

#### ⚡️ **Phase 2: Get Comfortable with the Standard Library**

* Learn built-in modules (os, datetime, itertools, etc.)
* Practice working with files and JSON
* Get comfortable with command-line tools and scripting

#### 🔥 **Phase 3: Dive Deeper into Advanced Concepts**

* Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, design patterns)
* Decorators, context managers, and iterators/generators
* Type hinting and best coding practices

#### 🐍 **Phase 4: Build Projects & Solve Real Problems**

* REST APIs with Flask or FastAPI
* CLI tools for productivity and automation
* Scripts for data cleaning, scraping, and processing
* Unit Testing with `unittest` or `pytest`

#### 🌐 **Phase 5: Learn Frameworks and Libraries**

* Web Frameworks (Flask/Django)
* Data Science (Pandas, Numpy)
* Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

#### 🚀 **Phase 6: Push Boundaries — Cloud, Automation & Beyond**

* Build and deploy services using AWS/Azure
* Learn CI/CD pipelines and git best practices
* Practice Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* Integrate with other services via REST APIs

### 🏁 Goal

Develop end-to-end proficiency — from writing clean, idiomatic Python code to building robust, maintainable, and testable applications.
**Why?** To evolve from a seasoned Senior Software Engineer into a highly skilled Python and DevOps professional.
